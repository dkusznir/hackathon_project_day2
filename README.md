# hackathon_project_day2
The overall goal of today is to end up with a ROS node that can control the pan-tilt servo mechanism. This node will eventually be added to our old launch file and configured to communicate with the output of our image processing code to do the tracking. We will be doing some basic soldering, reading datasheets, and writing Python code to make this happen.
